Spinners are the digital hourglasses of the modern web. They keep users informed that something is happening in the background, turning wait time into anticipation.

<ComponentShowcase component={<SpinnerShowcase />} code={`import { Spinner } from "@/components/ui/spinner"

const LoadingComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-4">
      <Spinner size="sm" />
      <Spinner size="default" />
      <Spinner size="lg" />
      <span>Loading...</span>
    </div>
  )
}`} />

## Installation

First, make sure you have the required dependencies:

<InstallationCommand component={'spinner'} />

## Usage

Here's how to add a spinner to your loading states:

```tsx
import { Spinner } from "@/components/ui/spinner"

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = React.useState(true)

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? (
        <div className="flex justify-center">
          <Spinner />
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div>Content loaded!</div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `size` | `"sm" \| "default" \| "lg" \| "xl"` | No | The size variant of the spinner |
| `className` | `string` | No | Additional CSS classes for custom styling |

## Features

- **Multiple Sizes**: From tiny to extra large for different contexts
- **Smooth Animation**: CSS-based animation for optimal performance
- **Theme Integration**: Uses your design system colors
- **Flexible Positioning**: Easy to center or align as needed

## Common Issues

1. **"Spinner is not spinning!"** - Check if you have Tailwind CSS properly configured
2. **"Wrong color!"** - The spinner uses border colors, ensure your theme has proper border definitions
3. **"Too fast/slow!"** - Animation speed is controlled by CSS, modify the animate-spin class if needed
